```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Cmd+C`: Copy complete prompt to clipboard
- `Cmd+V`: Paste complete prompt to active app
- `Cmd+Shift+C`: Copy individual keyword only
- `Cmd+R`: Clear all selections
- `Space`: Select/deselect keyword
- `Enter`: Open custom prompt editor or select keyword

## Best Practices

### Keyword Selection Strategy

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with one or two keywords and gradually add more as needed
2. **Match Complexity**: Use Think for basic tasks, Think Hard for complex ones, Ultrathink for the most challenging
3. **Consider Context**: Web Search for current events, thinking modes for analysis depth
4. **Progressive Thinking**: Start with "think" and escalate to "think hard" or "ultrathink" as needed

### Common Combinations

#### For Code Reviews
- Think Hard + Verify Results + Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### For Research Tasks
- Web Search + Think Hard + Detailed Output

#### For Quick Help
- Think + Concise Output + Code Only (if applicable)

#### For Learning
- Think + Detailed Output + Step-by-Step Reasoning + Multiple Approaches

#### For Complex Analysis
- Ultrathink + Tool Chaining + Verify Results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Keywords Not Working**: Ensure you're using the complete generated prompt, not just the keywords
**Extension Not Loading**: Run `npx ray dev` in the extension directory
**No Response Improvement**: Try combining complementary keywords or using a higher thinking level

### Performance Tips

- Use progressive thinking levels (think ‚Üí think hard ‚Üí ultrathink) based on complexity
- Combine Parallel Tool Calls with multiple tool-using keywords
- Use Concise Output when you don't need detailed explanations
