### üîç Search

#### Web Search
- **Purpose**: Enables Claude's web search capabilities for current information
- **Use Case**: Questions requiring up-to-date information, current events, recent developments
- **Keyword**: `Please search the web for current information on this topic.`
- **Example**: Asking about recent software updates, current market conditions, or latest research findings
- **Note**: Particularly useful for information beyond Claude's training cutoff date

### üìÑ Output Control

#### Concise Output
- **Purpose**: Requests brief, direct responses without unnecessary elaboration
- **Use Case**: Quick answers, time-sensitive situations, when context is limited
- **Keyword**: `Please be concise and direct in your response.`
- **Example**: Getting quick syntax help, brief explanations, or yes/no answers

#### Detailed Output
- **Purpose**: Requests comprehensive, thorough responses with full explanations
- **Use Case**: Learning, documentation, complex problem analysis
- **Keyword**: `Please provide a detailed and comprehensive response.`
- **Example**: Tutorial requests, architectural decisions, or educational content

#### Code Only
- **Purpose**: Returns only code without explanations or comments
- **Use Case**: When you only need the implementation, not the explanation
- **Keyword**: `Return only the code without explanations or comments.`
- **Example**: Quick code snippets, configuration files, or when adding to existing codebases

### üí° Reasoning

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning
- **Purpose**: Breaks down complex problems into manageable steps with clear reasoning
- **Use Case**: Learning, debugging, complex problem-solving
- **Keyword**: `Please break this down step by step and show your reasoning.`
- **Example**: Mathematical problems, algorithm design, troubleshooting issues

#### Multiple Approaches
- **Purpose**: Requests Claude to consider and compare different solutions
- **Use Case**: Architecture decisions, optimization problems, creative tasks
- **Keyword**: `Please consider multiple approaches and compare their trade-offs.`
- **Example**: Choosing between different frameworks, optimization strategies, or design patterns

#### Verify Results
- **Purpose**: Requests Claude to double-check and validate its work
- **Use Case**: Critical tasks, financial calculations, security-related work
- **Keyword**: `Please verify your results and double-check your work.`
- **Example**: Code reviews, data analysis, or any high-stakes decision making

## Best Practices

### Keyword Selection Strategy

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with one or two keywords and gradually add more as needed
2. **Match Complexity**: Use Extended Thinking for complex tasks, Concise Output for simple ones
3. **Consider Context**: Web Search for current events, Think Tool for critical decisions
4. **Balance Cost vs Quality**: Higher thinking budgets provide better results but cost more

### Common Combinations

#### For Code Reviews
- Think Tool Usage + Verify Results + Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### For Research Tasks
- Web Search + Extended Thinking + Detailed Output

#### For Quick Help
- Concise Output + Code Only (if applicable)

#### For Learning
- Detailed Output + Step-by-Step Reasoning + Multiple Approaches

#### For Complex Analysis
- Extended Thinking + Tool Chaining + Verify Results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Keywords Not Working**: Ensure you're using the complete generated prompt, not just the keywords
**Extension Not Loading**: Run `npx ray dev` in the extension directory
**No Response Improvement**: Try combining complementary keywords or adjusting thinking budget

### Performance Tips

- Use Thinking Budget to control response time and cost
- Combine Parallel Tool Calls with multiple tool-using keywords
- Use Concise Output when you don't need detailed explanations
